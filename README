About ibus-icelandic:
    Currently it only supports icelandic character inputting (no error checking, etc).

Keymap:
    The kaymap layout is different from layout of the modern icelandic keyboard.
    But it's pretty simple and straight forward:
        everykey except <q>, <w>, <z>, <c>: the corresponding characters in English;
        <w>: ö
        <z>: ð
        <c>: æ

    And <q> is used as "modify key"; pressing q (or Q) will toggle on/off Icelandic-specific
    (compared with English) characters' inputting. For example:
        <qa> or <Qa>: yields "á";
        <qE> or <QE>: yields "É";
        <qqa>: still "a".

    Finally, þ and Þ are bound to <qt> and <qT>.

Switching between English and Icelandic:
    Just use right shift!

Compile (with ibus already installed and configured correctly):

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    (sudo) make install
